# Polio-SIV-Model -- Overview:

This is the code to run the SIV (susceptible-infected-vaccined) model from the 2013 American Journal of Epidemiology publication: "Successes and shortcomings of polio eradication: a transmission modeling analysis."  

The details of the model have been written up in the AJE paper and its supplement.  The structure of the model is shown in [Model_Diagram.pdf](https://github.com/bryanmayer/Polio-SIV-Model/blob/master/Model_Diagram.pdf).
